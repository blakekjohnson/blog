tldr: "A knob-twisting DAW-less jam since getting a mixer and thoughts around personal projects"

After sitting and reflecting on the countless projects that I've let fall to
the waistside - this blog included - I decided that I need to do some things to
help escape the innate urge I have to start projects that I never finish and
re-frame how I view creating things in general. Instead of striving for some
imaginary ideal sharing what I have done instead of existing in some state of
limbo. It also gives me a neat way to reflect on what I've done. 

I've been struggling a lot lately with the idea of "making a song". Sitting in
front of a set of synthesizers, sequencers, and drum machines and trying my
hardest to make something work. But I don't know how to make a song. My
exposure to music theory is learning the bare minimum about the major and minor
scales in order to avoid making things sound _overly bad_. The idea of sharing
fun sounds I've found felt like the only option was a pretty package with
some semblance of song structure, lyrics, cover art, etc. Now I've come to the
conclusion that I'm not at the point where this is something that I can do and
that's perfectly fine.

In an act of impulsivity I decided to get a mixer that was on sale at Guitar
Center - The Yamaha MG10UX. I already have a cheap mixer I got on Amazon that I
had been using for a while but it just wasn't up to par with what I felt I
needed/wanted. The mixing options were limited, no sort of effects and not
enough inputs (which this new mixer also certainly does not have enough of but
that's a problem for a different day).

Once I got everything set up rather than try to immediately hop into "making a
song", I decided to take the time to [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM).
After some reading, routing, and tweaking I felt excited to take part in one of
my new favorite past-times of making sounds - but this time I didn't feel the
need to write things down or save a patch or try to make a bunch of different
sections. I laid out a chord progression, basic drum pattern, and a simple lead
melody then started tweaking and twisting knobs - which feels like a return to
what made me so interested in being on the maker side of music in the first
place.

For the future I think I want to have a bit more movement going on, rather than
having such a static track introduce some more variation in the lead melody.
The result feels like a villain's theme in some anime a la Perfect Cell's Theme.

Here's the track:
