tldr: "First knob-twisting DAW-less jam since getting a new mixer + thoughts around personal projects"

After sitting and reflecting on the countless projects that I've let fall to
the waistside - this blog included - I decided that I need to do some things to
help escape the innate urge I have to start projects that I never finish and
re-frame how I view creating things in general. Instead of striving for some
imaginary ideal shifting my mindset to sharing what I *have* done instead of
existing in some half-finished, hidden state. One of the biggest areas where I
want to implement this new way of handling personal projects is with music.

I've been struggling a lot lately with the idea of "making a song". Sitting in
front of a set of synthesizers, sequencers, and drum machines while trying my
hardest to make something work. But I don't know how to make a song. My
exposure to music theory is learning the bare minimum about the major and minor
scales in order to avoid making things sound _overly bad_. When it comes to the
idea of sharing fun sounds I've found it felt like the only option was to craft
a perfect package with a super coherent song structure, lyrics, cover art, etc.
Now I've come to the conclusion that I'm not at the point where this is
within my skills and that's perfectly fine. Sitting around twisting knobs and
pushing buttons while a loop plays has always been something I enjoy, and
sharing something that I enjoy doing is the platonic ideal of a personal
project.

In an act of impulsivity I decided to get a mixer that was on sale at Guitar
Center - The Yamaha MG10UX. I already have a cheap mixer I got on Amazon that I
had been using for a while but it just wasn't up to par with what I felt I
needed/wanted. The mixing options were limited, no sort of effects and not
enough inputs (which this new mixer also certainly does not have enough of but
that's a problem for a different day). But the biggest reason for getting the
mixer was for improving the overall state of my setup and to ease the struggles
I was having routing audio, MIDI, and power on my office floor.

Once I got everything set up rather than try to immediately hop into "making a
song", I decided to take the time to [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM).
After some reading, routing, and tweaking I felt excited to take part in one of
my new favorite past-times of making sounds - but this time I didn't feel the
need to write things down or save a patch or try to make a bunch of different
sections. I laid out a chord progression, basic drum pattern, and a simple lead
melody then started tweaking and twisting knobs - which feels like a return to
what made me so interested in being on the maker side of music in the first
place.

The result feels like a villain's theme in some anime a la Perfect Cell's Theme.
In the future I think I will focus in again on having some sense of movement.
The melody gets a bit stale here and I think it'd be cool to have _maybe_ two
sections instead of one to sort of break up the repetition. **Anyways...**

Here's the track:
