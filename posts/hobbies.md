If someone were to ask me what my hobbies are today I would struggle to give
them a comprehensive list. If they entered my home and tried to come up with
their own they'd probably end up with a list that looks like this:
* Watching movies
* Making noises with synthesizers
* Compiling photo albums
* Spinning and collecting records
* Messing around with home servers and electronics
* Attempting to learn bass
* Reading "classics"
* Playing old GameCube games and modding controllers
* Halfway completing crosswords
* Playing board games with friends
* Building LEGO

And while that list isn't particularly wrong for some reason I can't bring
myself to say that list is entirely true either. What makes a hobby? Is
consistency an important factor? If one person does their hobby of choice more
often than others does that make a difference? If we boil down that last list
based on consistency (with an extremely heavy receny bias) we get something
closer to this:
* Making noises with synthesizers
* Messing around with home servers and electronics
* Playing old GameCube games ~~and modding controllers~~

But surely consistency isn't the core of what makes a hobby and it's really all
about the individual and their relationship with the activity. Even if I go
months without sitting down and watching a movie that will still always be one
of my favorite activities. My attempts to learn bass go as far back as when I
was ten years old and thought that it looked cool, even if I still can barely
move up and down the neck it's still a relaxing and rewarding hobby for me.

One of the most common questions when meeting someone for the first time is
"What do you do?". Most of the time I naturally - like most other people - talk
about what I do for work. For some reason I feel as though the things I do in my
spare time from the first list aren't "valid" enough to share. As if I have to
pass some threshold of _success_ or **frequency** to call them a hobby. At the
end of the day there is no right or wrong, as long as they give me joy 
and I should proudly claim my hobbies.
