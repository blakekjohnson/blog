  <p>I feel like most of the way that society operates around elevators is
fundamentally broken due to no one caring about their fellow human. Common
elevator etiquette should be followed by most people and can be summed up into
a few general rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those leaving the elevator get right of way</li>
<li>The disabled, the elderly, and children get priority when leaving</li>
<li>The reverse priority order should be maintained when entering the elevator</li>
<li>Everyone should wait until the elevator doors fully open before moving</li>
</ol>
